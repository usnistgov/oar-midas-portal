        "projectDescription": "This project provides the necessary measurement infrastructure to enable high confidence in manufacturing reliable devices containing advanced materials (herein 2D and wide-band gap materials). Reliability and provenance are often not considered early in electronics development, but they are essential steps of advanced electronic systems necessary for national security and defense applications.  This project addresses a significant pitfall in electronics for national security that are based on wide-band gap materials and builds out measurement framework for early adoption of next-generation electronics containing 2D materials as functional components.\nFirst Challenge: Most GaN material and resulting high-frequency and power devices are manufactured overseas. This prevents these advanced devices from being utilized for domestic national security and defense needs because device and material provenance cannot be established.  Alternatively, materials and products from domestic suppliers are largely untested with regards to material quality, wafer-to-wafer reproducibility, and device performance. Together, these shortcomings mean that national security needs are effectively handicapped because modern GaN electronics cannot be used.\n\nSecond Challenge: While the use of 2D materials for microelectronics is called out in the Strategic Opportunities for U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing Integration of 2D materials, and these materials are actively developed by Intel, TSMC and IMEC, material stress, strain and defect states, and deviations from theoretical performance are examples of challenges that all must be overcome to build reliability into these electronics as they are scaled up. Many of the material aspects that contribute to the advantageous properties of 2D materials (i.e., single-layer of exposed atoms) lead to a complex matrix of problems currently limiting implementation of 2D material-based electronics. Material integration, material stress, strain and defect states, and deviations from theoretical performance are examples of challenges that all must be overcome to build reliability into these electronics as they are scaled up.  \n\nThis project will (1) remove roadblocks in qualifying GaN electronics from domestic sources and provide guidance on measurements that address reliability in wide-band-gap materials, and (2) overcome the early challenges preventing use of 2D semiconductors and provide the essential metrologies for evaluating material quality and methods for evaluating reliability of 2D logic devices for ultimate CMOS scaling.\n",

        "projectDescription": "Numerous gases are used in the production of semiconductor chips, and the accurate metering of these gases into the process chamber is critical for maximizing device throughput and yield. Many of these gases are hazardous, and flow standards for hazardous gases do not exist, forcing the industry to rely on approximate \u201cmeter factors\u201d to extrapolate a meter calibration carried out with nitrogen to the actual process gas. Our project will improve this situation by providing standards for the metering of hazardous gases. These will include physical models for meter performance across gas species and the gas thermophysical property data needed in those models; they will be validated by a flow standard operating with a range of semiconductor process gases. These models and properties will enable a meter calibrated with nitrogen to provide accurate measurements of hazardous process gases.",

These measurements are dependent on the results of the first phase and precise measurements of mass flow controller (MFC) dimensions, gas volume, and ambient temperature and pressure. Data from these measurements will enable the derivation of flow rates for the list of process gases and their uncertainties, which will, in turn, lead to models for any generic MFC. \n\nAll data described above are recorded in text formats.

The strategy is to develop measurement technologies, properties data and standards focused on contaminant identification to support uniform materials quality and traceability. New and updated documentary standards will assure manufacturers receiving materials of the provenance and consistency in the quality when purchased\u2014and quickly alert stakeholders to changes in supply. New measurement technology with increased sensitivity and throughput for detection of gas contaminants can be deployed throughout the supply chain, including reliable and traceable isotopic analysis for material provenance.\n\nIf successful, impurity analysis on carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at the part-per-trillion (ppt) or lower level in commercial gases and after point-of-use gas purifiers is expected in 1\u20133 years. Benchmarked spectral reference data on hard-to-measure laser gases, etchants, and implant gases like sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrogen fluoride (HF), and silane (SiH4) will be shared in widely used public databases for the direct application by industry in their optical diagnostics. Finally, gas primary standards for common trace impurities will be developed. After five years, the development of documentary standards and the dissemination of new NIST Standard Reference Materials\u00ae characterized by the new gas primary standards will enable the specialty gas industry to measure and verify higher quality gas products being sold directly to the semiconductor manufacturing industry.\n",

The realization of this goal during the project period will be demonstrated by: 1) the development of measurement procedures for critical organic contaminants at 1 ppb or below, 2) the development of measurement procedures for non-critical organics below 3 ppb, 3) identification and/or development of challenge materials with a range of chemical and physical properties for testing the efficiency of ultrafiltration systems, 4) the development of UPW0 for quantifying ultrafilter performance to particles as small as 1.5 nm at number densities below 1 \u00d7 105 L-1, and 5) development of methods for rapid surface particle-, and impurity detection and quantification in water/non-water solvents in the concentration range of interest.",

        "projectDescription": "Chips manufacturers use a variety of high-purity solid materials, such as silicon, germanium, copper, gold, silver, GeSi, AlGaN, etc., in their processes.  Reliable chips require that these source materials be extremely pure and that they be qualified based on overall purity and priority contaminants.  For bulk materials (e.g., sputtering targets), direct solids analysis techniques, notably glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS), are used for purity evaluation.  GDMS is used because of its extremely low detection limits, which lead to unsurpassed quality in bulk purity evaluations.  However, relative measurement uncertainty for a given contaminant is often not better than a factor of two or more, because of the lack of matrix-matched certified reference materials with which to calibrate it.  Consequently, characterization of the materials used in the industry is not as robust as needed considering necessary changes in materials vendors and ever more stringent industry requirements.  Development of SRMs consisting of these extremely pure source materials and having certified purity assay values, as well as certified values for priority contaminants and information on spatial heterogeneity, will enable improved instrument calibration and validation, resulting in much better source materials characterization, which directly translate to higher productivity and lower risk of material waste. \nWe will develop new Standard Reference Materials (SRMs), Reference Materials (RMs), and Research Grade Test Materials (RGTMs) of high-purity solids currently lacking in chips manufacturing, enabling more effective, efficient, and comparable characterizations of source materials, as well as process control improvements.  To achieve these goals, we will develop new NIST capabilities in glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) and laser-based analytical methods, and we will significantly lower detection limits for existing NIST nuclear techniques.",

        "projectDescription": "Precise measurements of thermal properties at the nanoscale are needed for engineering of both advanced and heterogeneously integrated electronic devices but are currently unattainable. We will radically advance thermal properties metrology by developing a new tool for mapping thermal conductivity (\u03b7), interfacial thermal conductance (G) and chemical composition at the nanoscale, with high throughput (20 ms/pixel) and high precision (\u0394\u03b7 <5%, \u0394G <10%), concurrently. Thermal properties will be obtained by measuring the transient photothermal expansion of a sample with high spatial (\u224810 nm) and temporal (\u22484 ns) resolutions using NIST-made optomechanical AFM probes and wide-bandwidth detection. Synergistically, we will develop a far-field, super-resolution microscope capable of mapping thermal properties with \u2248 500 nm resolution, ultrahigh throughput \u2248 5 \u00b5s/pixel (\u2248 24 million times faster than the state-of-the-art) and with depth sensitivity up to \u2248 100 \u03bcm.\n\nThis project will:\n1.\tFurther develop the photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) microscope by modifying an AFM with optomechanical probes, a custom excitation laser and by expanding the spectral range of the detection laser while developing advanced data processing routines.\n2.\tDevelop a Super-resolution photothermal microscope \u2013 which will use a CW visible detection laser and a high bandwidth detector to measure the time-domain thermalization of the sample at once, either in reflection or transmission.\n",

In the AFM, the optomechanical AFM probe tip transduces the local time-domain photothermal expansion of the sample and a detector which is fiber coupled to the probe senses the tip position. The super-resolution microscope uses a CW laser and a far-field detector to transduce the time-domain photothermal transient of the sample (i.e., changes of the sample refractive index) either in transmission or reflection. Data will consist of local nanoscale signal transients obtained either by maintaining the probe stationary and sweeping the excitation laser wavelength (local spectra), or by maintaining the excitation laser wavelength fixed and scanning the probe (AFM tip or CW detection laser) on the sample surface (2D nanoscale maps). 3D nanoscale maps will be obtained with the super-resolution microscope by scanning in 3D a two-photon absorption beam to generate a localized heat source at depth in the sample. Derived data from the raw data will yield maps of composition, thermal conductivity (\u03b7), interfacial thermal conductance (G), sample topography with nanoscale resolution.\n\n\nWhen using conventional AFM probes for routine AFM measurements the dataset will be more limited and the data will be in proprietary formats (.axz). Preliminary two-photon absorption measurements will be stored in the HDF5 format. \n\nPump-probe measurements use a Princeton Instruments proprietary format, SPE, and data after averaging is stored in HDF5 format. \nThe non thermal data (AFM maps, IR spectra) are saved on Ansys instrument/Bruker proprietary format  .axz but those are typically much smaller files.\n\n",

        "dataDescription": "The project will be generating data through both experimental and computational methods. Experimentally, the project utilizes a Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) array to measure the X-ray fluorescence spectra of various materials. The TES array is a cryogenic microcalorimeter that detects the temperature rise caused by X-ray photons, which is then converted into an electrical signal. The measurement process involves exposing a sample to an X-ray source, and the TES array detects the fluorescence X-rays emitted by the sample. The resulting data is a time series of pulse records, which are then processed to extract the X-ray energies and their corresponding uncertainties. The processed data is stored in a custom binary file format, known as \"ljh files\", which contains metadata and raw 16-bit numbers representing the timing information and temperature data. The experimental data will be distilled down to energy distributions or spectra, which will be the primary data product.\n\nComputationally, the project involves simulations of atomic theory to calculate X-ray energies, which will be used to support the experimental measurements. The computational data will be generated using High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, such as the Blackbird, Redwing, or other clusters. The simulations will produce data on the theoretical X-ray energies and their uncertainties, which will be used to validate the experimental results. The computational data will likely be stored in a format suitable for HPC output, although the specific file format is not mentioned. The project also involves data processing and analysis using custom algorithms, such as the pulse processing algorithm, which will be used to extract the X-ray energies from the experimental data. The algorithm and simulation data may be published through the METAS portal, allowing for easy discovery and access by other researchers. Overall, the project will generate a range of data types, from raw experimental data to processed spectra and computational simulations, which will be stored in various file formats and made available through different channels.",

        "projectDescription": "Project Description:\nThe semiconductor industry continues to push for smaller features, more integration, and increased yield. New photoresist chemistries and advances in extreme ultraviolet lithography are enabling this trend. However, this is inhibited by a lack of measurements describing heterogeneities in chemistry that contribute to the quality of photoresist patterns at these smaller dimensions. This includes fundamental questions into how the EUV exposure changes the resist chemistry and its spatial extent, and the underlying mechanisms that produce those changes. Our proposed NIST team will characterize the properties of advanced lithographic materials, measure nanoscale chemical distributions, and study the patterning process in situ. This will be accomplished by further developing a suite of metrology techniques which have tailored sensitivity to both the chemistry and structure of the photoresists and how the exposure processes influence critical dimensions and edge roughness. Completion of the project will provide industry with a roadmap to rapid characterization of new EUV resist formulations and processing approaches that will further enable high yield manufacturing and accelerate US industry competitiveness in this space.\n\nThis project will:\n1.\tConduct soft X-ray whole film spectroscopy (reflectivity) and vertical depth profiling for photoresists and underlayers: \na.\tProduce an absorption spectroscopy data library for EUV and DSA materials\nb.\tcompare spectroscopic collection modalities including electron yield, transmission, and low-dose imaging.\n2.\tEUV latent image characterization using soft X-ray scattering\na.\tDevelop soft X-ray scattering approaches to display of chemical heterogeneity within latent images (i.e., three-dimensional spatial extent of chemical changes undergone by EUV photoresists during exposure and subsequent processing steps), with nanoscale resolution.\nb.\tBeamline modifications (camera upgrade and sample holder redesign from 4 to 5 axes) to enable fully three-dimensional measurements of the latent image.\n3.\tCharacterization of block copolymers for EUV pattern rectification - Correlate commensurability between the block co-polymer (BCP) and the EUV pattern relates to the device line-edge roughness (LER).\n4.\tReal-time AFM probe methods for monitoring of photoresist development \u2013 in situ AFM measurements of the resist development process using NIST\u2019s nanophotonic AFM probes and on-chip integrated microdisk photonic resonators for readout.",

The primary limitation of CDSAXS is measurement throughput due to the lack of compact X-ray sources with sufficient brightness. The scattering intensity, and thus the measurement time, scales with the square of the height of the structure   \nThe industry needs NIST to use their unique expertise in the CDSAXS method to provide continued support through advanced measurement and standard development. \n\nThere are three thrusts to the project: 1) Demonstration of CDSAXS on next generation devices such as GAA nanosheets and TSVs using a best available laboratory SAXS system and synchrotron facilities, 2) Collaboration with X-ray source developers to identify potential game changing X-ray technology and to direct their efforts to the CDSAXS application, and 3) Development and certification of new IP-neutral industrial-relevant test structures and leveraging of NSTC capabilities.",

For industrial optics-based measurements such as scatterometry, focused research must begin now to address high-throughput measurements of the dimensional properties of new materials and devices such as GAA and CFETs.  This non-destructive technique will allow the characterization of surfaces, buried features, interfaces, and devices with increased resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, and throughput.  Only using these shorter wavelengths can process control metrology keep pace with cutting-edge and future microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing, while maintaining a competitive U.S. advantage. Present optical methods cannot go below 10 nm in feature sizes.\n\n\nThis project will: \n\u2022\tDevelop two new measurement capabilities: \no\tSynchrotron-based EUV ellipsometry for thin film optical properties characterization  \no\tLab-based EUV Scatterometry for dimensional and materials measurements of patterned features \n \n\u2022\tUse coupled wave theory to determine the sensitivity to scattering (evaluate parameters such as wavelengths, incident angles, polarizations, and diffraction orders) from specimen of varying dimensional and material parameters. These simulations will also demonstrate feasibility of scatterometry in the EUV band. \n\u2022\tConduct EUV diffractometry in collaboration with Prof. Margaret Murnane Group at the University of Colorado \n\u2022\tCreate a Mueller Matrix ellipsometer, which will be used to demonstrate spectroscopic ellipsometry characterization of thickness and optical constants of thin films on a substrate.\n\u2022\tEstablish CRADA with companies like KLA and Onto Innovation \n\u2022\tCompare Synchrotron results with Tabletop EUV High-harmonic generation (HHG) results. \n\u2022\tPerform Tabletop EUV HHG scatterometry for CRADA partners, NSTC, and refine measurement techniques. \n",
